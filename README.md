# fitDaily
## Introduction
Fitness is an integral part in maintaining a healthy life, and having a good hygiene helps in many
daily activities and can especially improve studying or working. As digital natives, many of the younger
generations are accustomed with a ‘out-of-shape’ lifestyles – always facing their gadgets and rarely
getting out of the comfort of their homes to take a jog or go to the gym. This is especially applicable to
those studying or working with computers. With that being said, some are unable to follow through
simple fitness regimens or exercise routines; others find it too tedious while some are unable to allocate
time to fit one in their schedule. As such, there is perhaps nothing else more to do other than to simply
make these simple training routines even simpler.
## Object Oriented Analysis
A simple application which provides easy-to-follow routines and tips is optimal. It is
recommended that the UI is user-friendly in terms of appearance and usability so that catering to
younger audiences and non-techy demographics are able to use the program with relative ease. Above
all, it must be practical. The following are the essentials of such an application:
* Easy to navigate – fewer buttons to click as much as possible
* Simple – the guide must be doable by the general public and not reliant on equipment
* Assistive – the app should provide features which may provide details on the user’s health
* Friendly – UI should be inviting to people of all ages

The technical features of this application include:
1. Main Menu – contains all accessible features including: guide for daily exercise, BMI and BMR
calculators, general tips ; serves as the hub for which all other tabs/windows may go back to.
2. Daily exercise – clickable buttons show another window which contains the guide for that
specific day, as well as possible links to third-party guides which provide more extensive
coverage on the regimen.
3. Tips – provide general tips which should be followed and maintained at all times.
4. BMI and BMR calculators – asks the user to input their height and weight, the BMI and BMR of
the user are then calculated. A table is provided for the user to determine their weight body type
classification.

## Object Oriented Design
The OOP design principles and concepts used were encapsulation and inheritance. Encapsulation
was applied in order to contain multiple variables and code into a single unit which may be accessed
from within whilst protected from code outside of the capsule. Setter and Getter methods are the main
methods used to access and get data from encapsulated classes. Inheritance, on the other hand, is used
mainly in the Day classes, which inherits from the JFrame class. The main application of this principle is
through setting the JFrame class as the blueprint upon which its subclasses are based on. The classes
which are involved are:
* fitDaily()
* BMI()
* BMR()
* Day()
* Day2()
* Day3()
* Day4()
* Day5()
* Day6()
* Day7()
* Day8()
  
As well as classes from Java libraries, such as Java Swing (part of the Java Foundation Classes), Standard
Widget Toolkit (SWT), and Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT). The WindowBuilder extension for Eclipse was
used for easier GUI creation.

## Conclusion
The once tedious, and at times, perplexing coding methodology in procedural style can be more easily
understood using OOP. This revolutionary programming technique not only makes it easier to write code,
but it also makes it easier to read code written in OOP-style. The usage of Object-Oriented techniques in
the analysis of code (OOA), designing software (OOD), and coding itself (OOP), has taught us that even
the simplest tasks can be made even simpler.
This is true not only in programming, but also in real life. Software allows us to make everyday tasks
much, much easier. The application of programming in creating software is heavily responsible for
making it easier to do daily activities. Using software applications can extensively enhance an
individual’s lifestyle and make it easier to do many tedious tasks.
Upon completion of the source code for this application, we have found that it was easier to pass around
code to other co-authors. Reading code written by others is more understandable since it was in OOP.
Though we have yet to fully discover it, we were able to get a glance on the countless applications that
Object-Oriented Programming has.
